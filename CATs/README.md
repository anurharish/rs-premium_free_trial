These are Cloud Application Templates (CATs) used for the RightScale Premium Free Trial (PFT) offering.

These CATs make certain assumptions:
- They are fully portable. If a CAT needs something to exist in Cloud Management (e.g. ServerTemplate, SSH key), they import or otherwise create it as part of the CAT itself.
- They use standard cloud names and network offerings. If used in an environment that requires using specific networks, etc they will need some modifications (at this time).
- They are purposely simple and self-contained so that customers can quickly understand how to use them.
- Some CATs are examples only and are designed to raise errors - they are there to illustrate the breadth of what we can do.
