Name: PFT Load Balancer with HAProxy for Chef Server (RightLink 10)
Description: "Load Balancer with HAProxy for Chef Server ServerTemplate.   RightLink10
  is a new agent to connect servers to the RightScale platform that is very lightweight
  and simple to install.\n_It is not a plug-in upgrade from the older RightLink v6
  series._\nSee [http://docs.rightscale.com/rl/about.html](http://docs.rightscale.com/rl/about.html)
  for details.\n\nIn addition to installing HAProxy, this ServerTemplate runs a script
  to update the packaging system and enable automatic security updates, and a collectd
  install script to enable RightScale monitoring. \n\nThe ServerTemplate can run on
  most any Linux distro that supports cloud-init. It is recommended to use the standard
  distro images in various clouds.\n\n__ Requirements__\n\n * Chef Server or Hosted
  Chef\n * [rs-haproxy](https://github.com/rightscale-cookbooks/rs-haproxy) ([2.0.0](https://github.com/rightscale-cookbooks/rs-haproxy/releases/tag/v2.0.0))\n\n__Key
  Features:__\n\n * Downloads source code, builds, and installs HAProxy and configures
  the server to act as the front-end for all HTTP(S) requests.\n * Recipe to attach
  existing application servers in the deployment.\n * Recipe to set up load balancer
  machine tags on the server.\n * Monitoring HAProxy process.\n * Basic set of recipes
  for a RightLink-based server with logging, monitoring, alerts, tagging, etc.\n *
  MultiCloud Images that reference the latest supported images with a frozen and tested
  software repository date.\n * Basic set of alerts for most server type monitoring.\n
  * Examples of system-required input variables.\n\n__Documentation:__  \n\n* [Overview](http://docs.rightscale.com/st/rl10/lb/overview.html)

Alerts:
- Name: rs instance terminated
  Description: Raise an alert if the instance has been terminated abnormally, i.e.
    not through the RightScale interface or by an elasticity daemon resizing server
    arrays.
  Clause: If RS/server.state == terminated for 1 minutes Then escalate critical
- Name: rs instance stranded
  Description: Raise an alert if the instance enters the stranded state.
  Clause: If RS/server-failure.state == stranded for 1 minutes Then escalate warning
- Name: rs instance not responding
  Description: Raise an alert if the instance fails to send monitoring information
    for 5 minutes.
  Clause: If cpu-0/cpu-idle.value == NaN for 5 minutes Then escalate critical
- Name: rs cpu busy
  Description: Raise an alert if the idle time is too low.
  Clause: If cpu-0/cpu-idle.value < 15 for 3 minutes Then escalate warning
- Name: rs cpu overloaded
  Description: Raise an alert when the cpu idle time is too low.
  Clause: If cpu-0/cpu-idle.value < 3 for 5 minutes Then escalate critical
- Name: rs cpu I/O wait
  Description: Raise an alert if disk io is too high.
  Clause: If cpu-0/cpu-wait.value > 40 for 15 minutes Then escalate warning
- Name: rs low space in root partition
  Description: Raise an alert if the available space in the root partition is too
    low. This alert may be modified on an instance to match the metric name df/df-root.free
    instead if the instance is running collectd 4. See the RL10 Linux Setup Alerts

  Clause: If df-root/df_complex-free.value < 1073741824 for 5 minutes Then escalate
    critical
- Name: rs high network tx activity
  Description: Raise an alert if the amount of network data transmitted is too high.
    This alert may be modified or cloned on an instance to match the actual network
    interfaces that are present. See the RL10 Linux Setup Alerts RightScript (rll/setup-alerts.sh)
    for more details.
